                        <h3><b> Email Marketing: </b></h3>
                        <p>At Samayu, we send weekly emails to keep users informed about our latest initiatives, campaigns, and opportunities to contribute. These emails provide valuable updates, insights, and ways to engage with our mission for animal, people, planet. While we aim to share meaningful and relevant content, we respect users' preferences and offer full control over their subscription choices. If a user no longer wishes to receive these emails, they can easily opt out using the unsubscribe link provided in every email. Once unsubscribed, users will stop receiving marketing emails, though important service-related communications may still be sent. We ensure a transparent, user-friendly, and non-intrusive communication experience, and for any assistance with email preferences, users can always reach out to us.</p>
                        <h3><b> Third-Party Ads:  </b></h3>
                        <p>At Samayu, we do not display or host any third-party advertisements on our website. Our platform is dedicated solely to our mission of promoting animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and community well-being. We prioritize a distraction-free experience for our users, ensuring that all content remains focused on our initiatives, updates, and engagement opportunities. Any external links or references provided on our website are strictly for informational purposes and do not serve as advertisements. Our commitment is to maintain a clean, ad-free, and mission-driven digital space for all visitors.</p>
